# Deployment Guide

## Why Your Live Site Looks Different

The main issues that caused differences between local and live versions:

1. **Static Export Issues**: The site was using `output: 'export'` which creates static files that don't support client-side animations properly
2. **CSS Conflicts**: Excessive fallback CSS was overriding animations and causing visual inconsistencies
3. **Font Loading**: Google Fonts weren't loading consistently in production
4. **Animation Conflicts**: Framer Motion animations weren't working in static export

## Fixed Issues

✅ **Removed static export** - Now uses proper Next.js server-side rendering
✅ **Cleaned up CSS** - Removed conflicting fallback styles
✅ **Improved font loading** - Added proper font preloading
✅ **Added animation fallbacks** - Content is visible even if animations fail
✅ **Fixed build process** - Added missing dependencies

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Test Production Build Locally
```bash
npm run start
```

### 4. Deploy
Use your hosting platform's deployment process. The build files are in the `.next` directory.

## Key Changes Made

### next.config.js
- Removed `output: 'export'` and `trailingSlash: true`
- This enables proper client-side rendering for animations

### app/layout.tsx
- Removed excessive fallback CSS and JavaScript
- Added proper font preloading
- Simplified the layout structure

### app/globals.css
- Removed conflicting `!important` declarations
- Cleaned up component styles
- Maintained essential animations

### Components
- Added inline style fallbacks for animations
- Ensured content is visible even if Framer Motion fails

## Troubleshooting

### If animations still don't work:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Ensure Framer Motion is loading properly
3. Verify that client-side JavaScript is enabled

### If fonts look different:
1. Check if Google Fonts are loading
2. Verify font preloading is working
3. Check browser network tab for font requests

### If colors are wrong:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check if Tailwind CSS is loading properly
3. Verify CSS build process

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your hosting platform:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- Any API keys or environment-specific variables

## Performance Tips

1. **Use the deployment script**: `./deploy.sh`
2. **Test locally first**: Always test with `npm run build && npm run start`
3. **Monitor build output**: Check for any warnings or errors
4. **Clear cache**: Clear browser cache when testing changes

## Common Issues

### Build Fails
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify all imports are correct

### Animations Not Working
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Check if Framer Motion is loading
- Verify client-side rendering is working

### Styling Issues
- Clear browser cache
- Check if Tailwind CSS is building properly
- Verify CSS is loading in the correct order
